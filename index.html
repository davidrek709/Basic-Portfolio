  <h>About Me</h>
  <p> Programming has been an interest of mine since around middle school when I played my first game, I took a
    programming class in High School
    which allowed me to create simple calculators and games based on buttons. Programming took a backseat when i started
    playing soccer and just
    recently I decided that this is what I want to make a career from. Traveling is a big factor in my life, whenever I
    have free time I love to
    travel with family or friends.

  <p> I've started to fill up my portfolio with interesting projects to showcase the skills I've learned with html, css,
    and java. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Javascript is a large language that takes several months, I'm dedicated to learning as much as I can.</p>
